CVE-2019-0717: Hyper-V vmswitch.sys Out of Bounds Read DoS Vulnerability

I found this bug in 2018 with a custom fuzzer that I wrote as part of the initial reconnaissance of Microsoft Hyper-V architecture and attack vectors. This is a Tier 1 [host OS kernel] vulnerability per the [Microsoft's taxonomy](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-hyper-v), that qualifies for a $50K bounty via the [Microsoft Azure Bounty Program](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-microsoft-azure).
